John, I pulled data from two twitter accounts Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer, two successful contestants of the game show Jeopardy. I ended up successfully pulling 804 tweets from James and 3211 tweets from Ken. This data set includes both the user IDs, the user names, and the full texts of their tweets.

Nice work. These aren't the most sophisticated analyses, but you do a good job with them. The results are clear, the code 
looks good, and the write-up is easy to read. Consider this **complete**.

1244050264388071424	the ep is good because Kahless is SO SAD when he realizes why he‚Äôs bad at knife-fighting and his only memories are scriptures. plus you get to say ‚Äú...Shoe Source‚Äù every time they say his name.

1244045444398768128	Worf has to figure this out, which always cracks me up. dude spends his days announcing security alerts on deck 9 and then once a season he gets called in to save the Klingon empire. Then he goes back to his middle management job
1244044400193204224	hilariously, Kahless doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs a fake. ‚ÄúI...I am?‚Äù He spends the rest of the ep moping and staring out windows
1244044097930706944	at the end of the second act, we find out Kahless has been cloned to seize power from a center-left government, inviting the audience to imagine Jerry Falwell lab-growing a fake Jesus to do same.

1244042143934668806	Worf leaves the Enterprise to go to a Klingon spiritual mountain retreat, like the Beatles in ‚Äò68. In the very next scene, he thinks it sucks and tries to leave, like Ringo.
